(1, 'Conor Pope', 'Young woman’s bank account emptied because of an unfortunate coincidence', 'Pricewatch: Young student followed a link sent to her in a text message\r\n', 'Sometimes coincidences can cost a lot of money. Last week, a young Turkish woman – who we shall call Bahar, although that is not her real name – contacted us after losing almost all her savings to a criminal enterprise, largely as a result of a very unfortunate coincidence. Bahar came to Ireland to study English just more than 10 months ago and as well as her studies, the science graduate found herself a job working as a car park attendant in Dublin. Given that she is planning to spend some time in Ireland, one of the first things she did was to get her finances sorted and to set up a bank account. With the pillar banks not making life easier for her, and many others in her position, when it came to opening a bank account, she opted for one of the digital banks – a local company called Money Jar. Founded in 2019, the fintech offers a digital current account with an Irish IBAN. Effectively, people who sign up get access to a virtual bank account quickly and easily, as well as a prepaid debit card which they can use in much the same way as one of the debit cards issued by a more traditional bank. One of the unique selling points of Money Jar, apart from the fact that it is Irish, is that it promotes mindful spending and saving. The app allows users to allocate different amounts of money to different “money jars” to save for particular goals – be it a holiday, a mortgage or something less significant. So, Bahar worked and studied and she saved and over the course of the time she was here, she had managed to set aside just more than €2,000. She hoped the money would help her cover, at least in part, the cost of a master’s degree programme in Ireland in the months ahead. The mindful money people at Money Jar seemed ideal for managing her savings. Things, however, were about to go off the rails .Not long before Christmas, she did what many people do and she sent cards to her friends and family at home. One card sent to a friend in Turkey never arrived at its destination. Bahar thought it was strange but figured it was probably caught up in the festive mail madness and didn’t give it a whole lot of thought. “I was thinking it was just a delay going to Turkey and it was Christmas time so, with the holiday and everything, I thought it was okay that she got it so late. ”Then, a text message arrived, purportedly from An Post. The message said: “Your parcel address is not delivering properly. Please update and repay the courier fee of €1.95″. The message also contained a link. Given that she had recently had an interaction with the Irish postal service – her first, as it happens – and given that the interaction was still incomplete as the card that she had sent had never arrived, Bahar, understandably perhaps, put two and two together and assumed that there must have been a problem with the address she had written on the card she had sent her friend in Turkey. The fact that English is not her first language and that she is unfamiliar with the workings of An Post – who would never ask a customer for their bank details in a text – did not work in her favour and she followed the link. “My friend didn’t get the post card because there was [a] delay and it didn’t go to her house so I thought it might be because of a wrong address like the message said,” she says. “So, I clicked the link and filled in all the info about her address. I just filled in all the blanks and I shared my bank account details and I sent it. ”You may have already guessed what happens next. Bahar went about her day but not before checking her online bank account to see if the €1.95 had been taken by An Post, which would mean her friend would soon get her post card. “I thought this amount of money would be taken from my account but there was nothing, so I was thinking maybe something was a bit strange,” she continues. While she thought it was odd, the alarm bells had not started ringing, or, at least, they were not ringing very loudly. “I was checking and checking again and then, maybe five hours later, all my money was taken in three parts. When I realised that I was shocked and I contacted my bank and said there was something happening on my account and it was completely without my consent. ”Money Jar immediately blocked her account. “But my money was gone. I wrote a complaint form and told them I had been sent this fake scam message and all my money – €2,000 – was taken by a fake company. After maybe 40 days, they replied saying we investigated the situation but unfortunately, we can’t give you your money back. It is all my savings. ”She says she is disappointed that the bank did not flag the initial transaction as suspicious. “In my bank account, I normally don’t have a huge amount of payments with other people so it would have been unusual,” she says. “It was a very unfortunate coincidence but I got these scam texts before from AIB and other banks, but because I have not got a relationship with them, I knew they were scams. ”Now, to be fair to Money Jar, we have come across stories of this nature on far too many occasions over the last couple of years and all banks and financial operators tend to follow the same rules. If you are hoodwinked by a criminal enterprise into giving away your financial details, then it is entirely on you. Bahar was aware of this too and the main reason she made contact with us was not to retrieve her own money, but in the hope that by sharing her story she might save someone else from falling victim to a similar scam. Even though our reader was not confident anything could be done to retrieve her money – and in truth, neither was Pricewatch – we got in touch with the company to see what options were on the table for her and if a chargeback was possible. A chargeback is an interbank system that allows a credit or debit card customer who has paid for a service or product that they have not received to contact their bank, who will then contact the third party’s bank, have the transaction cancelled and then, ultimately, have the money restored to the initial customer. It seemed like a long shot but a long shot is better than no shot.\r\n', 'images\\article_01.jfif', '2023-02-19', '10:55:00', 1001),

The January total is also 1.4 per cent ahead of pre-Covid January 2020 when some 1.23 million arrived in the country from abroad.\r\nGregg Patrick, a CSO statistician, said that while the recovery was observed in both air and sea routes, it was “most pronounced” in air travel with 1.2 million people arriving at Irish airports in January, an increase 115.9 per cent from January 2022.\r\nHe said: “The recovery is also spread across all major routes, with transatlantic traffic up most (+126.4 per cent) in relative terms, increasing from 40,200 in January 2022 to 91,100 in January 2023.

The champions could find themselves five points behind leaders Arsenal come their next league game against Newcastle on Saturday if the Gunners beat Everton in midweek. Guardiola said at a press conference: “I have the feeling in the Premier League many things are going to happen. “Everyone is going to drop points but we cannot drop any if we are going to fight until the end”. Despite claiming a crucial victory over their chief title rivals at the Emirates Stadium earlier this month, City have been inconsistent since the World Cup. They restored some confidence after frustrating draws against Nottingham Forest and RB Leipzig in the last week, however, with a convincing 4-1 win at Bournemouth on Saturday. Guardiola said: “The game we are playing is good. The results could be better – in terms of winning at Spurs or Nottingham – but sometimes that happens\". \"Of course it’s not exceptional – it’s OK, it’s good – but I don’t have complaints with the way we are playing and fighting\". “I said after the last game against Bournemouth that the mood in the locker room is exceptional and the guys are doing everything, and that’s enough for me\". ”City are back in action on Tuesday as they travel to Championship side Bristol City in the fifth round of the FA Cup. Guardiola expects a reasonable test against Nigel Pearson’s side, who have not lost since Boxing Day. The City boss said: “Last 12 games no defeat – that gives me a lot of info. It means they are there\". “My scouts say they are good team, the manager has a lot of experience. He did really well at Leicester and Watford\" .“It’s a final. The FA Cup is an important competition, really important. It’s a serious team that is going to play tomorrow\". The game could provide an opportunity for £45million summer signing Kalvin Phillips to make a rare start. The England international has started just one game for City in a curious campaign in which he was expected to ease some of the midfield burden on Rodri. As well as injury problems, the 27-year-old was criticised by Guardiola for being overweight and he has struggled to get meaningful game time off the bench. Yet he was given 35 minutes at the Vitality Stadium at the weekend and could see more action in the season’s decisive weeks. Guardiola said: “Kalvin is adapting and adjusting a little bit. Some players need a bit more time\". \"I have the feeling he needs a little bit more time to learn more about our rhythm, but it was so important for him to play the minutes he played at Bournemouth for the rhythm\". “Of course we need him until the end of the season because there are many games, but Rodri is so important at the moment.

They hated each other by the way at the end of the whole thing.“But my sister Kelly and I were born from love and my father was from Hungary and my mother was from Denmark and they had nothing and they became these monstrous stars in this industry that they loved so much.“My parents were actors and I married an actor, I love actors. I love acting. I love the job we get to do, I love being a part of the crew, I love being a part of a cast. I love what we do with each other, it’s such a beautiful job.“And I know that so many people in our industry who are actors don’t get to do this job and you look at nights like this and think is that ever going to be possible for me.“And I know you look at me and think well ‘Nepo baby’ that’s why she’s there and I totally get it. But the truth of the matter is I’m 64 years old and this is just amazing.”She signed off her speech saying: “What a dream man.”It is not the first time Curtis has weighed in on the debate, sharing a statement in December on Instagram which said the conversation around the so-called nepo baby is “designed to try to diminish and denigrate and hurt”.She added: “I’ve never understood, nor will I, what qualities got me hired that day, but since my first two lines on Quincy as a contract player at Universal Studios to this last spectacular creative year some 44 years later, there’s not a day in my professional life that goes by without my being reminded that I am the daughter of movie stars.”Other celebrities who were branded as “nepo babies” in a 2022 article from Vulture magazine, titled An All But Definitive Guide to the Hollywood Nepo-Verse, thanks to their wealthy and famous parents include Hailey Bieber, Lily-Rose Depp, Miley Cyrus and Zoe Kravitz.Discourse surrounding “nepo babies” sparked a widespread backlash from a number of stars including singer Lily Allen and Noel Gallagher’s daughter Anais.In December, Allen, who is the daughter of actor Keith Allen, responded to the title on Twitter.She wrote: “The nepo babies y’all should be worrying about are the ones working for legal firms, the ones working for banks, and the ones working in politics, If we’re talking about real world consequences and robbing people of opportunity. But that’s none of my business.”She added: “And before you come at me for being a nepo baby myself, I will be the first to tell you that I literally deserve nothing.”Meanwhile in November last year, Anais responded to being branded a ‘nepo baby’, telling the Daily Mail: “I would be tone deaf if I didn’t admit how privileged my life is.“I’m really, really, extremely grateful for the situation my parents have been able to give me, and I’ll be grateful until the day I die.”\r\n', 'images\\article_04.webp', '2023-02-27', '12:45:00', 1007),
(5, 'Hugh Tucker\r\n', 'England\'s twin \'ghost villages\'\r\n', 'In 1943, residents of Imber and Tyneham were given a month to evacuate. Eighty years on, they remain uninhabited ghost villages – a testament to the communities that vanished.\r\n', '\"Pulling in at the side of the road, I called the Salisbury Plain Training Area military hotline and a recorded message informed me that the roads to the ghost village of Imber were open. I drove on, passing through barriers that usually prevent access to the village. Blown-out tanks flanked the road, signs warned me of the threat of unexploded military debris, and what was once known as \"\"the loneliest village in England\"\" felt a world away from the idyllic towns I\'d passed on my way here.\r\n\"\"Little Imber on the down, seven miles from any town\"\". As this old local rhyme demonstrates, the village was known for its remote location deep in a windswept valley in the rugged grasslands of Salisbury Plain, and this fostered the community spirit that allowed the villagers to survive the harsh winters on the plain.\r\nHowever, its isolated location was ultimately the reason for its demise.\r\n\r\nApart from the church, which has been restored, only the shells of a few original buildings remain due to damage from training and neglect. Despite this, Imber has no problem attracting visitors: pre-Covid, around 16,000 people visited each year to learn more about Imber\'s strange history and explore one of the least-accessible villages in the UK.\r\nI travelled there on the first of four open days in early January 2023, and convoys of mud-spattered cars lined the road approaching the village. Activity centred around the St Giles Church, and the bells rang out while people tended graves in the churchyard and explored the medieval interior. The church continues to hold an annual service for Remembrance Day, and those who lived in Imber are still eligible to be buried in the churchyard.\r\nImber\'s story continues to evolve in unlikely ways. The idea for Imberbus – the village\'s most popular open day – was born by chance in a Bath pub. Each summer, classic Routemaster buses ferry thousands of passengers across Salisbury Plain between the town of Warminster and Imber, raising a substantial amount of money for charity. Organiser, Lord Hendy of Richmond Hill, explained, \"\"We chose Imber because it was such an unlikely place to operate a bus service to, and it represented a particular challenge as access is impossible for all but a few days a year… we\'ve also made the village much more widely known.\"\"\r\nDespite the demand, continued access to Imber isn\'t guaranteed. Skelton explained that although the Ministry of Defence can grant up to 50 days of public access, they are only obligated to open one day each year, and, \"\"about five years ago, as a result of trespass, the number of public access days was cut to three\"\". However, Skelton explained he was able to persuade the Salisbury Plain Training Area Commandant, the officer in charge of the area, to subsequently increase this to the current allocation of 12-plus days. For now, though, these access days allow thousands of people to discover Imber\'s story and the relatives of Imber residents to retain a physical link with their past.\r\nImber wasn\'t alone in becoming a ghost village in autumn 1943. Fifty miles to the south, on a stretch of coastline designated England\'s only natural World Heritage Site, the car park at the village of Tyneham was full. Drivers waited for cars to leave, watching hopefully as dog walkers approached parked cars, and I looked out through my windscreen at the village that was brimming with people, despite also having a population of zero.\r\nOn 16 November 1943, an evacuation notice was issued to all households in Tyneham, an excerpt of which reads: \"\"The Army must have an area of land particularly suited to their special needs and in which they can use live shells.\"\" Chosen because of its small size and relative seclusion, residents of Tyneham were given just 28 days to leave. Although the notice didn\'t state whether the evacuation was to be permanent, residents certainly believed they would be coming back. One of the last to leave pinned a note to the door of the church that read, \"\"Please treat the church and houses with care. We have given up our homes where many of us lived for generations to help win the war to keep men free. We shall return one day and thank you for treating the village kindly.\"\"\r\nAfter World War Two ended, however, the government announced their decision to retain Tyneham as part of the Lulworth Ranges, a military area used by tanks and armoured vehicles for live-firing practice. A campaign to allow residents to return to the village was launched in the 1960s and a debate was held in Parliament, but the government\'s decision to retain the area for military training was deemed final. Although the village wasn\'t returned, limited public access was granted to Tyneham as well as footpaths across the firing area, and they are open most weekends and over certain holiday periods.\r\nAs I saw, there seems to be no shortage of people interested in visiting. A spokesperson from the Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO) that manages the site informed me that they estimate between 175,000 and 185,000 people visit Tyneham each year. And Lynda Price, who led the conservation and development of Tyneham from 1994 until her retirement in 2019, said that \"\"the best way to describe it is an accidental tourist attraction\"\". Walking into the village from the car park, I came to the cottages of Post Office Row and read the information boards sharing the stories of the people that lived there, like Gwendoline Driscoll who was the postmistress until the village was evacuated. While several ruined buildings were cordoned off behind metal fencing, exploring the schoolhouse, which looked like a lesson had just been interrupted, and sitting in the tranquillity of the church, it felt as though their occupants had recently been called away.\r\nRoughly a mile from Tyneham, and still part of Lulworth Ranges, is Worbarrow Bay, where even in the cold January weather, several people were braving the water. Climbing a short way up the steep coast path above the bay, I looked back at Tyneham nestled in its valley, then towards the stunning coastline of this stretch of the Isle of Purbeck peninsula with its chalk cliffs, surrounding heathland and rolling hills. I was struck by how beautiful it must have been to live here.\r\nIt\'s a tragedy that two communities that had survived for centuries were extinguished within the space of a month. But, while the residents of Imber and Tyneham can never call those villages home again, their use as military training areas and the consequent lack of development and settled human populations has meant that wildlife can thrive there.\r\nAround Tyneham, there are many rare flowers, fungi and insects, including the Lulworth Skipper butterfly, which is only found on this stretch of coastline. However, as the DIO spokesperson informed me, \"\"The real magic of Tyneham and other parts of the ranges is the mosaic of wildflower-rich grassland, ancient woodlands, mires and heaths that have largely escaped agricultural intensification as a direct result of being in Ministry of Defence ownership.\"\"\"\r\n', 'images\\article_05.jpg', '2023-02-27', '13:19:00', 1008),
(6, 'Gianda ferraglioni\r\n', 'The climate benefits of a four-day workweek\r\n', 'There\'s growing interest in the benefits of a four-day workweek for productivity and employee wellbeing, but the picture is more complicated when it comes to climate change.\r\n', '\"In 2011, Simon Ursell and the three other co-founders of newly born environmental consultancy Tyler Grange based in Gloucestershire, UK, decided to give all their workers a day off a month to volunteer.\r\nThey had found that many of their new employees already spent their free time volunteering in wildlife trusts. \"\"Our ecologists have always loved being ecologists,\"\" Ursell says.\r\nBut last year, Tyler Grange took what some would see as a far more radical step towards workers wellbeing by trying out giving all employees a fifth of their workweek off.\r\nThe company joined the world\'s biggest ever four-day workweek trial, which took place in the UK from June to December 2022. The pilot aimed to assess whether companies could maintain productivity with a reduced working time – and, importantly, with no loss in pay for employees.\r\nManagers and workers at Tyler Grange celebrated the breakthrough with enthusiasm, with their results showing daily productivity rose by 22%. But Ursell was also keen to measure another outcome: the impact of the shorter workweek on the company\'s carbon footprint. And the four-day workweek turned out to be surprisingly good for this too, he says.\r\n\"\"On average we saw a 21% reduction in the number of miles travelled by car,\"\" he notes with a cheerful smile. Tyler Grange cut out meetings and travel that were unnecessary. Many employees used their additional days off to become even more involved in climate volunteering.\r\nThe conversation around the four-day workweek is gaining momentum all over the world. The non-profit which coordinated the UK trial, 4 Day Week Global, had already carried out pilots in the US and Ireland, while the public sector in Iceland and companies in Spain, Sweden, Belgium, Japan and New Zealand have all tested the impact of a shorter workweek. \r\nBut the UK trial was the biggest yet, involving more than 60 firms and organisations. The final results were published on 21 February, and some of the companies are making bolder claims supporting what previous studies suggested: a shorter workweek could help the planet.\r\nJuliet Schor, an economist and sociologist at Boston College and lead researcher at 4 Day Week Global who worked on both the UK and US pilots, argues that a shorter working week is key to achieving the carbon emissions reductions the world needs.\r\n\"\"Although climate benefits are the most challenging thing to measure, we have a lot of research showing that over time, as countries reduce hours of work, their carbon emissions fall,\"\" she says. A 10% reduction in hours is associated to an 8.6% fall in carbon footprint, according to a study co-authored by Schor in 2012.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important contributors to the climate benefits of four-day workweek is a fall in commuting. Data from the UK trial shared with Future Planet shows a 10% decrease over the pilot period, from 3.5 hours to 3.15 hours per week, for the companies which tracked commuting time. While this is a significant fall, savings could reach 15-20%, Schor says. In the 2022 US trial the decline was even bigger, from 3.56 to 2.59 hours a week (a 27% decrease). \r\n\r\nBoth the UK and US trails also found that many people spent the time saved from not commuting or working engaged in low-carbon activities, such as hiking or stay-at-home hobbies. The UK data also showed that the shift to a shorter workweek led to an increase in pro-environmental behaviours: participants in the trial spent more time volunteering for environmental causes, and were more careful with recycling and buying eco-friendly products. \r\n\"\"When people work less, they have more free time for sustainable activities which are often more time-intensive,\"\" says Stefanie Gerold, a researcher at Brandenburg University of Technology in Germany, not involved in the UK or US trials who has developed various working time reduction models implemented in Austrian companies. \r\nVolunteering increased among the employees of both Waterwise, a UK non-profit which participated in the UK trial, and crowdfunding platform Kickstarter, which took part in the US trial. Jon Leland, vice president and head of sustainability at Kickstarter, says he observed workers in the company becoming more engaged socially and civically.\r\nAnd, sometimes, surprises show up. An unforeseen effect caught the eye of Tyler Grange during the UK trial: carbon emissions related to the sending and storage of data significantly dropped. Big data-storing centres can each consume the same amount of electricity as 50,000 homes, so that was another significant win. \"\"The lack of [online] business traffic on Fridays could have a substantial impact on emissions, possibly even more important than the drop in commuting,\"\" Ursell says. While the company didn\'t track exact use of data, he suspects the drop came from the team \"\"avoiding unnecessary internal comms\"\".\r\nImproving efficiency by avoiding overwork is the point of the four-day workweek. And efficiency is also about energy. More days off could result in more energy-efficient employees, says Laura White, projects and research manager at Waterwise. \"\"People are mindful when they\'re at home, because they\'re ultimately paying the bill.\"\" \r\nAmong nearly all the companies who took part in the UK trial, the verdict was positive: the shorter workweek is a blessing for business, and the same goes for the environment. More work-free days for future is ideal for the planet, then? Not so fast. \r\n\r\nSome experts observe that a reduction in working hours might pose others risks for the environment.\r\nPredicting how all people will use that extra day is tricky. People could jump on a highly polluting international flight to celebrate their fully paid Friday off. \"\"A three-day weekend could lead to a greater consumption of carbon-intensive goods and services,\"\" says Anupam Nanda, professor of urban economics and real estate at the University of Manchester, UK. \"\"If you end up taking a plane or driving a hundred miles for leisure activities, that can hardly help tackle the climate crisis.\"\"\r\nNeither the UK nor US trials measured the full carbon impact of any additional activities people may have done due to their extra day off. But while Philipp Frey, a researcher at the Institute for Technology Assessment and Systems Analysis in Karlsruhe, Germany, and author of The Ecological Limits of Work, says he understands the concern of potential additional leisure emissions, he notes that it doesn\'t seem to be validated for now.\r\nHe notes that one study showed people in North America and Europe have a lower carbon footprint on weekend days (weekend emissions did not decrease in East Asia). Overall, Sunday emissions in North America and Europe were found to be 40% lower than the average, while weekday emissions were nearly 20% higher than the average.\r\n\r\nData from the US Energy Information Administration also shows people in the US burn nearly 10% less fossil fuels on weekends than they do on weekdays. So he believes shifting Friday from a weekday to a weekend day could represent a significant improvement in fossil fuel emissions. \"\"These numbers show that the four-day week can really have a substantial impact,\"\" Leland says.\r\nSome data from the trials appear to be relatively reassuring, too. The number of domestic leisure trips taken by workers involved in the UK pilot decreased by 5.5% in four weeks, while there was almost no change in the number of international flights taken for leisure. Meanwhile, the US study found no change in domestic leisure travel, but international leisure travel more than doubled, albeit from a low base.\r\nTyler Grange, Waterwise and Kickstarter all say that they didn\'t notice any increase in long-distance travel. But it is worth noting that all three companies view themselves as climate-oriented companies. \"\"The environmental benefits were originally the reason why I reached out to the 4 Day Week campaign,\"\" says Leland from Kickstarter. Other companies\' employees could prove less environmentally friendly when it comes to deciding how to spend their days off. \r\nThat\'s why underestimating the risk of an increase in leisure-related emissions isn\'t a good idea, says Gerold from Brandenburg University. \"\"There is not much empirical evidence, you don\'t really know how people would use their extra time.\"\"\r\nThis means additional policies are needed to frame people\'s leisure time, says Gerold. Nanda agrees. \"\"We should invest in green infrastructure,\"\" he says. \"\"Eco-friendly facilities and neighbourhood green spaces should be created across urban areas too in order to encourage people to spend their free time in a sustainable way.\"\"\r\n\r\nThree-day weekends could lead to more carbon-intensive leisure plans – like taking flights. But it could also be spent on lower carbon activities (Credit: Lander Loeckx/Alamy)\r\nStill, despite the rising number of trials, there remains too little data to fully understand what the impact would be on the climate of moving to four days of work a week.\r\nIt can be hard to precisely measure some of the climate benefits due to other conflating factors. In 2022, for example, energy prices soared, making it harder to analyse the impact the four-day week had on any reductions seen in companies\' energy consumption. \"\"A six-month trial may not be enough in these cases,\"\" Schor says.\r\nIn any case, environmental concerns are not the main driver for many of the firms involved in the trials. That\'s why the climate impact didn\'t feature prominently in what was tracked compared to social and economic effects such as work-life balance and productivity.\r\nSometimes, companies are simply not aware there could be any benefits on climate. \"\"I met very few companies that really thought about a four-day week as something that would have a positive impact on the environment,\"\" Ursell says. \r\nOther employers simply have other priorities. \"\"The climate benefits are there, but for most firms they don\'t feel as tangible,\"\" says KT McBratney, founder of OwnTrail, a tech startup that participated in the US trial. \"\"It feels like a drop in the bucket.\"\"\r\nMore pilots are needed to get accurate data, she says. \"\"Firms have a duty to join these initiatives to give a boost to the research.\"\"\r\n\r\nBut is the four-day week really something that every company can afford? \"\"Practically speaking there\'s no downside, and it\'s feasible on a widespread basis,\"\" says Leland, but \"\"it takes courage to do it\"\".\r\nSometimes, employers only need a little push, and that\'s where government action comes into play. \"\"Political action is needed in order to drive such a big change. National governments must show the way,\"\" says Frey. The Spanish government recently confirmed it will pay up to €150,000 ($159,000/£133,000) to small and medium enterprises that test the four-day week.\r\nGovernment support could materialise in other ways too, says Frey, such as reducing by law the maximum limit of work hours, or acting as a pioneer itself. \"\"The public sector is one of the biggest employers in all European countries,\"\" he says. \"\"If it offers a four-day week, private companies will have to stay competitive to attract employees.\"\"\r\nStill, the more companies that themselves venture into this territory, the more governments will be pressed to act. \"\"These pilot programmes are really important to push the political agenda, especially if climate benefits enter the conversation,\"\" says Gerold.\r\nThe four-day week also has an edge over many other climate solutions: it\'s not perceived as a sacrifice. \"\"A shorter workweek with no loss in pay is joyful, \"\" says Leland. \"\"It\'s something that we all want.\"\"\r\n\"\r\n', 'images\\article_06.webp', '2023-02-21', '15:41:00', 1005),

Some 100 ambulances were involved in the effort to evacuate patients to other hospitals.\r\n\r\nA senior officer with Wexford fire services has said that the damage to the hospital building is “medium to small”. The fire was “not large” and had been confined to a small area in a plant room on the roof of the building.\r\n\r\nRay Murphy told RTÉ Radio’s Morning Ireland that he expected the hospital could be “back up and running” within days.\r\n\r\nREAD MORE\r\n\r\nRyan Baird a man in a hurry to make his mark for Ireland\r\nRyan Baird a man in a hurry to make his mark for Ireland \r\nShould newspapers really give conspiracy theories more space?\r\nShould newspapers really give conspiracy theories more space?\r\nSocial Democrats swiftly complete a no-drama leadership change\r\nSocial Democrats swiftly complete a no-drama leadership change\r\nGlenageary home sold for €6.5m as prime property market moves up a gear\r\nGlenageary home sold for €6.5m as prime property market moves up a gear  \r\nThe fire occurred in a section over a central hub that included maternity and paediatric wards, as well as the intensive care unit, he explained. The plant room contained the heating system, ventilation, air conditioning along with flammable material, all of which would have been “very, very safe” when operating under normal conditions, he said.\r\n\r\nMr Murphy said he suspected it was a piece of equipment that started the fire. “Maybe a pump. Or it could have been a mortar or a belt or something to that effect. But that still remains to be analysed.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFire damage on the roof of Wexford General Hospital. Photograph: Mary Browne\r\nFortunately the fire service was familiar with the building and already had a plan in place, added Mr Murphy. There was a very strong fire safety team in the hospital too. He said he would expect the hospital to reopen very soon, within days.\r\n\r\n“We know they can certainly start getting back up and running in days. But obviously to get the 207 patients back in, it’s going to take probably weeks and months. But I can see the hospital turning this around. Certainly in the next couple of days, they’re going to start putting the building together again.”\r\n\r\n‘War-like’ effort\r\nMeanwhile, the Cathaoirleach of Wexford County Council, Cllr George Lawlor, has commended emergency services for the “war-like effort” to evacuate patients and contain the fire which broke out at Wexford general hospital on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nCllr Lawlor told RTÉ Radio’s Morning Ireland that, of the 207 patients in the hospital, only 30 remained in the facility still requiring transfer.\r\n\r\nThe “remarkable war-like effort” had been co-ordinated between the emergency services and various voluntary and private bodies such as the Order of Malta, the Irish Red Cross, the Civil Defence, and companies including the Lifeline Private Ambulance to ensure that patients were efficiently and speedily transferred.\r\n\r\n“It was a logistical nightmare in reality. And it’s remarkable that we were down to the figure of 30 patients. Patients who were in intensive care and mothers with babies in incubators, newborn babies.”\r\n\r\nCllr Lawlor said it had been a distressing time for staff, one of whom was his daughter, a nurse, whom he understood accompanied a patient who was transferred from Wexford to Navan hospital.\r\n\r\nWexford TD Verona Murphy has praised the emergency services and hospital staff and management for the manner in which they handled the fire and subsequent evacuation. “It was a mammoth task,” she told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland. “And whilst it was chaotic, it was organised efficiently. “It just couldn’t have run more smoothly. And I’m sure there were things that we don’t know about, but for the most part it was about the preservation of life. And that was maintained.” However, many people were now concerned about missed appointments and when services would be restored, she said.\r\n\r\n“My primary focus as the public representative will be the restoration of services. And there’s been a lot of controversy in the last fortnight here in Wexford about the proposed 96 bed block for Wexford General Hospital.\r\n\r\n“We now have a prime opportunity in which to fast track that process regardless of where it is. It’s time to look at it now and to see how restoration and the new bed block can be incorporated.”\r\n\r\nSinn Féin’s health spokesperson David Cullinane has said that patient safety has to come first, when asked how quickly Wexford General hospital could reopen.\r\n\r\n“We all want the hospital to be opened as quickly as possible. I spoke to management at University Hospital Waterford, and they say they stand ready to support the hospital in Wexford. They have taken ICU patients and critical care patients.\r\n\r\n“Obviously community services are being looked at through nursing home capacity, private hospital capacity may have to be used as well. It’s a massive undertaking to evacuate that level of patients and obviously credit has to go to all of those who are involved in that,” he told RTÉ radio.\r\n\r\n“But I have to make the point that hospitals since the summer into the autumn and the winter have been operating at near 100 percent capacity. So it’s difficult when we hit a crisis point for hospitals to be able to respond. And that’s why patients had to travel far, because the capacity simply wasn’t in the hospitals in the region.”\r\n\r\nWexford Emergency Department will not be open over the coming days, and elective and outpatient procedures have been cancelled for today and tomorrow.\"\r\n', 'images\\article_07.avif', '2023-03-02', '08:19:00', 1009);

Cars line a roundabout enclosed by sprawling fields. The air is still, and it\'s calm. The real action is happening almost 20m underground.\r\n\r\nCarving through this underworld are more than 200km of cellars, with millions of Champagne bottles lining chalky rock walls, unlabelled and marked with the words \"\"I was here\"\" by tourists in the dust covering them. Some are upside-down, in chains, glowing in the dim light of the cellars against the backdrop of tunnels that seemingly lead to nowhere. Others are stacked in small caves guarded by wrought iron gates. This is ground zero of the world\'s Champagne market.\r\n\r\nAnd, historically in the caves, widows ruled.\r\n\r\nSome of the biggest innovations of Champagne came down to the ingenuity of several women. In the 19th Century, the Napoleonic Code restricted women from owning businesses in France without permission from a husband or father. However, widows were exempt from the rule, creating a loophole for Barbe-Nicole Clicquot-Ponsardin, Louise Pommery and Lily Bollinger – among others – to turn vineyards into empires and ultimately transform the Champagne industry, permanently changing how it\'s made and marketed.\r\n\r\nIn 1798, Barbe-Nicole Ponsardin married François Clicquot, who then ran his family\'s small textile and wine business, originally called Clicquot-Muiron et Fils in Reims. It turned into a financial disaster. When Clicquot died in 1805, leaving her widowed at 27 years old, she made the unconventional choice to take over the company.\r\n\r\n\"\"It was a very unusual decision for a woman of her class,\"\" said Tilar Mazzeo, cultural historian and author of The Widow Clicquot. \"\"It would have been extremely unusual for her to have a business, because she didn\'t need to… She could have spent her life in drawing rooms and as a society hostess.\"\"\r\n\r\nIn Reims, old Champagne bottles are stacked in an underworld of more than 200km of cellars (Credit: Lily Radziemski)\r\nIn Reims, old Champagne bottles are stacked in an underworld of more than 200km of cellars (Credit: Lily Radziemski)\r\n\r\nDesperately in need of money for the business, she asked her father-in-law for today\'s equivalent of about €835,000.\r\n\r\n\"\"Amazingly, her father-in-law said yes,\"\" Mazzeo explained, \"\"which I always think must say something really important about who he thought she was, and what he thought she was capable of as a woman with no business background.\"\"\r\n\r\nThe \'veuve\' suggested a certain kind of respectability to the beverage\r\nFrom the beginning, Barbe-Nicole used her widowed status as a marketing tool, yielding positive results. The Champagne house became Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin – the French word veuve translates into \"\"widow\"\".\r\n\r\n\"\"The \'veuve\' suggested a certain kind of respectability to the beverage… some of these beverages had gotten associated with the debauchery and wild parties of the royal courts of old,\"\" explained Kolleen M Guy, author of When Champagne Became French: Wine and the Making of a National Identity and chair, Division of Arts and Humanities at Duke Kunshan University in Jiansu, China.\r\n\r\nBarbe-Nicole Ponsardin took over what became Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin when her husband passed (Credit: INTERFOTO/Alamy)\r\nBarbe-Nicole Ponsardin took over what became Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin when her husband passed (Credit: INTERFOTO/Alamy)\r\n\r\nTagging \"\"veuve\"\" onto a bottle brought clout, and other Champagne producers – such as Veuve Binet and Veuve Loche – soon followed suit.\r\n\r\n\"\"The companies that didn\'t have a widow at the head of the household would create kind of off-brands, like a veuve off-brand, so they could try to capture this trend,\"\" Guy said.\r\n\r\nDespite Barbe-Nicole completing a four-year apprenticeship with a local winemaker to better learn how to make the business grow, it was once again on the brink of collapse in the early 19th Century. She secured another €835,000 from her father-in-law to salvage it. However, doing this during the Napoleonic Wars in continental Europe wouldn\'t be easy, as border closures made it difficult to move product around. \r\n\r\nBut by 1814, Barbe-Nicole knew that she was running out of options. Faced with bankruptcy, she turned to a new market: Russia. While Russia\'s border was still closed towards the end of the Napoleonic wars, she decided to run the blockade.\r\n\r\nAdding \"\"veuve\"\" (meaning \"\"widow\"\") onto a Champagne bottle such as Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin brought clout (Credit: Lynne Sutherland/Alamy)\r\nAdding \"\"veuve\"\" (meaning \"\"widow\"\") onto a Champagne bottle such as Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin brought clout (Credit: Lynne Sutherland/Alamy)\r\n\r\n\"\"She made this huge gamble, where she knew that if she could get her product into Russia before Jean-Remy Moët, who was her arch-rival, she would be able to capture some market share,\"\" Mazzeo said. \"\"Otherwise, once the border was legally open, Moët\'s Champagne was going to arrive, and Moët would continue to be the dominant player in that very important Russian export market.\"\"\r\n\r\nSo, Barbe-Nicole smuggled thousands of bottles across the border. The risks were high as it was late in the season and the heat could ruin the Champagne. And if caught, the bottles would be confiscated, contributing to more financial ruin. Fortunately, the Champagne arrived in perfect condition and took the market by storm. \r\n\r\n\"\"In 90 days, she went from being an unknown player [in Russia] to being \'The Widow\',\"\" Mazzeo said. \r\n\r\nWith the demand came a need to increase production fast. The process of removing dead yeast cells from the bottom of bottles – a necessary step in Champagne-making following the aging and fermentation process – was tedious and damaging to the quality. But Barbe-Nicole had a better idea.\r\n\r\n\"\"She basically said to her winemakers, \'take my kitchen table down to the cellar – I want you to poke some holes in it and let\'s just turn these [bottles] upside-down. Don\'t you think that would be a better way of getting the yeast out? The yeast would settle in the neck of the bottle, we could pop it out, that would be faster, wouldn\'t it?\',\"\" Mazzeo recounted. \"\"Everybody said \'no, no no, we can\'t do it that way\'.\"\" But they acquiesced.\r\n\r\nThat technique known as \"\"riddling\"\" is still a critical part of the Champagne-making process today (Credit: David Freund/Getty Images)\r\nThat technique known as \"\"riddling\"\" is still a critical part of the Champagne-making process today (Credit: David Freund/Getty Images)\r\n\r\nIt worked. That technique is became known as \"\"riddling\"\" (to make holes in something) and is still a critical part of the Champagne-making process today. \r\n\r\nThe second widow to revolutionise the industry was Louise Pommery. Born in 1819, Pommery entered into the Champagne scene towards the end of Clicquot\'s life. When she was young, her mother sent her to school in England – an unusual move that would later play to her advantage.\r\n\r\n\"\"She wasn\'t just taught how to sew,\"\" said Prince Alain de Polignac, the great-great-grandson of Louise Pommery. \"\"[Her mother] gave her an education, which was unusual for a bourgeoise girl of that time.\"\"\r\n\r\nAfter her studies, she married Alexandre Pommery, who partnered with Narcisse Greno in 1856 to build up his existing Champagne house, creating Pommery et Greno. In 1858, Alexandre died. For Louise Pommery, the next move was clear. Eight days after his death, she stepped in to take over.\r\n\r\n\"\"Destiny swooped in, and Madame Pommery was ready,\"\" said de Polignac. \"\"She had a 15-year-old son and a baby in her arms, and instead of returning to her mother\'s home, she decided to take [the Champagne house] over.\"\"\r\n\r\nPrince Alain de Polignac looks at a portrait of Louise Pommery (Credit: Lily Radziemski)\r\nPrince Alain de Polignac looks at a portrait of Louise Pommery (Credit: Lily Radziemski)\r\n\r\nWhile Clicquot might have captured Russia, Pommery was determined to own the English market.\r\n\r\nAt the time, Champagne was painfully sweet – some bottles would have up to 300g of residual sugar compared to the more typical 12 or so grams today – and it was served over ice, sort of like a slushie. As such, the English, who typically had a drier palette, didn\'t have a taste for it. But Pommery felt that she could make a Champagne that would get them hooked.\r\n\r\nHer brut Champagne hit markets in 1874. The style was distinctively dry, fresh and lively. It was perfectly balanced with a light-hearted nose, delicate but assertive. \r\n\r\n\"\"The idea was to make a wine that was a lot more fine, with assemblage a lot more subtle, a much longer time in cave…\"\" de Polignac said. \"\"This exploded on the English market, because that\'s what they were waiting for.\"\"\r\n\r\nChampagne tourism arose under the guise of the widows. Whereas most Champagne-makers built chateaux after achieving success in business, Pommery did the opposite, building an estate as a means of attracting success.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Louise Pommery in the mid-20th Century, Lily Bollinger emerged on the scene.\r\n\r\nShe took over the Bollinger Champagne house in 1941 when Jacques Bollinger, her husband and the owner of the brand, passed. At the time, women\'s rights to business ownership were still restricted (it wasn\'t until 1965 that women were granted full rights to employment, banking and asset management without permission) though widows were still able to circumvent the rules.\r\n\r\nChampagne tourism arose under the guise of the widows (pictured: Champagne House of Veuve Clicquot) (Credit: Hemis/Alamy)\r\nChampagne tourism arose under the guise of the widows (pictured: Champagne House of Veuve Clicquot) (Credit: Hemis/Alamy)\r\n\r\n\"\"She decided to take over the management – she could have sold the business,\"\" explained her great nephew, Etienne Bizot.\r\n\r\nBollinger brought her Champagne to the US. For three months, she travelled all over the country carting around her wines, alone. According to Bollinger\'s official history, she gained such popularity that she was named \"\"the first lady of France\"\" by the Chicago American newspaper in 1961.\r\n\r\nA few years later, Bollinger released the R.D. (recently disgorged) vintage Champagne, a technique that she innovated by aging the bottle with its lees, the dead yeast and grape skins, for extended periods of time and then removing the sediment from the bottle by hand. The Champagne is still one of the brand\'s most coveted cuvees today.\r\n\r\n\"\"I think what\'s unusual about the widows is that they [don\'t] remarry,\"\" Guy explained. \"\"In a way, I think they didn\'t do it because had they remarried, they would have had to turn over some of the business to their husbands… They\'d lose their legal status, so in some ways, it was a way to keep their independence.\"\"\r\n\r\nThe independence and creativity of the three widows paved the way for generations of women to come, and their innovations are immortalised in glass bottles.\r\n\r\n\"This group of women really changed something – they were pioneers that were very engaged in the key moments [of Champagne-making], and that importance is still represented,\"\" said Mélanie Tarlant, a twelfth-generation winemaker and member of La Transmission, Femmes en Champagne, a women-led association for Champagne-makers. She makes non-dosé (low sugar-dosed) Champagne, noting that Pommery was the first to pioneer the technique that she still uses today.\r\n\r\n\"It could have been lost in time.\"\r\n', 'images\\article_08.webp', '2023-03-02', '17:09:00', 1008),

Its opponents say it would be damaging to the environment and against President Biden’s climate goals.\r\n\r\nWhat is the Willow Project?\r\nThe project would involve drilling down to use the petroleum stored on the Alaskan North Slope. It is said doing so could produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil a day, which is around 1.5 per cent of the total U.S. oil production. It would represent the biggest US oil field in decades.                                                                                                                                       Alaska Republican US Senator Dan Sullivan said it would potentially be “one of the biggest, most important resource development projects in our state’s history”.\r\n\r\nHow big would the project be?\r\nFive drilling sites have been proposed by the project builders, ConocoPhillips Alaska. Three sites were previously put forward by the US Bureau of Land Management. However, the US Interior Department, which oversees the bureau, has expressed “substantial concerns” over both options.\r\n\r\nWhy is it controversial?\r\nEvidence has shown that the Willow Project would produce the equivalent of more than 278 million tonnes (306 million short tonnes) of greenhouse gases over its 30-year life. This is roughly equal to the combined emissions from two million passenger cars over the same time period.                                                                           On average, about 499,700 barrels of oil a day flow through the trans-Alaska pipeline, well below the late-1980s peak of 2.1 million barrels.\r\n\r\nIs there support for the Willow Project?\r\nYes. There is widespread political support in Alaska, including from those in power — Republican Governor Mike Dunleavy and state lawmakers.\r\nThere also is “majority consensus” in support in the North Slope region, said Nagruk Harcharek. He is president of the group Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, whose members include leaders from across much of that region.\r\n\r\nSupporters have called the project balanced and say communities would benefit from taxes generated by it. They say these would be used to invest in infrastructure and provide public services in the area.\r\n\r\nSo who is against it?\r\nThe project looks to be against President Biden’s beliefs.\r\n\r\nBiden has made fighting climate change a top priority. He has backed a landmark law to accelerate expansion of clean energy such as wind and solar power, and move the US away from the use of oil, coal and gas.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental campaigners also have expressed grave concerns.\r\n\r\nThe environmental group Earthjustice has urged opponents to call the White House to demand the project’s rejection.\r\n\r\nWhat are the politics of the decision?\r\nMr Biden’s dilemma centres on a row starting between Alaskan lawmakers and environmental groups. Democrats in Congress are also closely watching what he will decide, as they say the project is out of step with his goals to slash planet-warming carbon emissions in half by 2030 and move to clean energy.\r\n\r\nEnvironmentalists say approving the project would represent a betrayal by Mr Biden, who promised during his 2020 election campaign to end new oil and gas drilling on federal lands.\r\n\r\nWhen is a decision due?\r\nIt is expected that a decision will come this month, and as early as within the next two weeks.\"\r\n', 'images\\article_09.jfif', '2023-03-01', '10:43:00', 1006),

He remained as education secretary until September 2021 when Mr Johnson reshuffled his cabinet.\r\n\r\nUnions \'just hate work\'\r\nMessages between Mr Hancock and Sir Gavin in May 2020 show them discussing a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for schools.\r\n\r\nSir Gavin said he wanted to make sure PPE was provided so schools \"\"can\'t use [a shortfall] as a reason not to open\"\", and that some would want to use it as \"\"an excuse to avoid having to teach\"\".\r\n\r\nIn October, Sir Gavin announced that A-level exams would be delayed by several weeks, a shorter period than some unions had called for.\r\n\r\n\"\"Cracking announcement today,\"\" wrote Mr Hancock to Sir Gavin. \"\"What a bunch of absolute arses the teaching unions are.\"\"\r\n\r\nSir Gavin replied: \"\"I know they really really do just hate work.\"\"\r\n\r\nCovid hearings begin in court of public opinion\r\nMinister: Hancock leaked messages are \'very selective\'\r\nMr Hancock responded with some emojis of a person laughing and another of a dart hitting a bullseye.\r\n\r\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, told BBC Breakfast the reported comments made by Sir Gavin were \"\"contemptible because we have to remind ourselves that this was an age of extraordinary anxiety. We hadn\'t got vaccines.\"\"\r\n\r\nMr Barton said there was a \"\"very snarky debate\"\" going on about whether face coverings should or shouldn\'t be worn.\r\n\r\n\"\"The very people who then brought those young people back into school are being described in those snide terms by the former education secretary,\"\" he said.\r\n\r\nSir Gavin Williamson says he considered resigning in protest at school closures in January 2021\r\nHe added that as someone who wants the \"\"brightest and best\"\" young people to become politicians, \"\"that is less likely this morning because of that sneering denigration of the teaching profession\"\".\r\n\r\nWriting on Twitter following the latest leaks, Sir Gavin said he wanted to \"\"clarify that these messages were about some unions and not teachers\"\".\r\n\r\n\"\"I have the utmost respect for teachers who work tirelessly to support students. During the pandemic, teachers went above and beyond during very challenging times,\"\" he added.\r\n\r\nMr Gibb has defended Sir Gavin Williamson, telling LBC: \"\"People say things in the heat of the moment on WhatsApp that they don\'t really believe.\r\n\r\n\"\"Gavin\'s own wife is a primary school teacher. I\'ve worked with Gavin for two years; I know he holds teachers in the highest regard.\"\"\r\n\r\nPupils \'sent home with false positives\'\r\nOther leaked messages purportedly show that children who tested positive for Covid, but might not actually have had the disease, were sent home anyway because officials did not want to \"\"unpick\"\" a policy that had already been written.\r\n\r\nWhen schools returned after the third lockdown in March 2021, government policy said a child who tested positive with a lateral flow test should isolate for 10 days, even if they later tested negative with a PCR, a more reliable test.\r\n\r\nMr Hancock asked advisers to look into the issue but was told that the policy had been \"\"written and distributed and schools prepared\"\" and that it would be \"\"difficult to unpick now\"\".\r\n\r\nOnly three weeks later, on 30 March, the policy was indeed \"\"unpicked\"\", and schools were told that a positive lateral flow test should be confirmed by a PCR.\r\n\r\nFace mask row\r\nThe latest leaks also appear to show that an August 2020 change in government policy requiring secondary pupils in England to wear face masks was introduced mainly to avoid a row with the Scottish government.\r\n\r\nSchool face masks worn to avoid Covid row - claims\r\nEngland\'s Chief Medical Officer Sir Chris Whitty had reportedly been ambivalent about the need for the measure. Following its introduction in Scotland, Mr Johnson posted in a WhatsApp group asking whether the UK government would need to change its stance.\r\n\r\nDowning Street\'s director of communications Lee Cain warned that \"\"nervous parents would freak out\"\" if Scotland\'s example was not followed, while Sir Chris said there were no strong reasons for or against the policy, and the issue was \"\"not worth an argument\"\".\r\n\r\nA change in the government\'s policy was announced that night.\"\r\n', 'images\\article_10.webp', '2023-03-02', '10:54:00', 1006),

Yet today beer is the best-selling alcoholic beverage in the country.\r\n\r\nSales of sake have been further squeezed by the continuing popularity of a spirit called shochu, plus whisky, wine and \"\"highballs\"\" - canned drinks that mix either fruits or whisky with fizzy water.\r\n\r\nThe figures showing the decline of sake are pretty stark. Between 1973 and 2020, annual domestic sales fell by 75%, according to one report. Meanwhile, the Brewers Association of Japan said in 2021 that home market demand had shrunk by 30% over the past decade.\r\n\r\nThankfully for Japan\'s more than 1,100 sake breweries, there is one shining light - continuing strong overseas sales. Exports of sake in 2021 totalled 40.2bn yen ($294m; £243m), according to the Japan Sake and Shochu Makers Association. It added that this was a record high for the 12th year in a row.\r\n\r\nGenki Ito says some sake producers are making some of their products taste more like wine\r\nSo what is driving this international growth? Jumpei Sato, chief executive of sake brewer Tatenokawa, says that a growing appreciation of Japanese food and culture certainly helps.\r\n\r\nYet he explains that sake producers are also continuing with a successful policy of focusing on exporting some of their best bottles. \"\"Overseas export and high-end sake are key elements for our future management,\"\" says Mr Sato, who is the sixth generation to make sake at Tatenokawa.\r\n\r\n\"\"Of course the domestic sector is also important, but it is equally vital to be recognised in the new global market. I think it will give a bright future for Japanese sake.\"\"\r\n\r\nMr Ito says that in addition to focusing on quality for the export market, producers are also adjusting their recipes to increase the level of natural acid in the sake, and slightly reduce the alcohol content, so as to make it taste more like wine.\r\n\r\nThe idea here is both that sake will appeal more to wine enthusiasts, but also so that it can better pair with richer, fattier and often dairy-based Western food.\r\n\r\nPresentational grey line\r\n\"\"With this attention on acidity and ability to pair with food, brewers are designing the taste of sake to cater to consumers outside of Japan,\"\" adds Mr Ito. \"\"They think that the wine communities around the world are the most susceptible and appreciative of works of art craft sake brewing.\"\"\r\n\r\nThis targeting of the wine enthusiast community appears to be a continuing success, as a number of prestigious wine-tasting competitions around the world now have sake categories running along the likes of best US chardonnay or pinot noir.\r\n\r\nTo help make sakes more wine-like, a number of producers are even bringing on board former winemakers.\r\n\r\nTatenokawa is working with a new sake producer called Heavensake, which is a Franco-Japanese business. Its founder Regis Camus was previously head winemaker at champagne house Piper Heidsieck.\r\n\r\nWhile Heavensake\'s sakes are still, quality sparkling sake is available and increasingly growing in popularity. Another former champagne big wig, Richard Geoffroy, previously of Dom Perignon, also now makes sake.\r\n\r\nHeavensake is also said to benefit from champagne\'s decades of marketing and advertising know-how.\r\nHeavensake sakes are blended by a former champagne-maker\r\n\"\"I believe international collaboration and cultural exchange on liquid, packaging and marketing concepts for sake will open new doors, and make it more relevant and successful outside Japan,\"\" says Heavensake\'s chief executive, Laurent Cutier.\r\n\r\nHe adds that international sales of high-end sake were helped by the coronavirus pandemic. \"\"Consumers were exploring new products and categories while being stuck at home.\"\"\r\n\r\nUK wine writer Jamie Goode is also a sake expert, with an advanced level qualification in the Japanese drink.\r\n\r\n\"\"Lighter, fruitier sakes are the ones that are really flying at the moment on the international market,\"\" he says. \"\"They are more accessible for people used to wine, who can appreciate them more easily than some of the more traditional sakes.\r\n\r\n\"\"Sake is obviously not as mainstream as wine, but it does seem to be having a bit of momentum.\"\"\r\n\r\nCourtney Kaplan, the co-owner of Los Angeles sake bar and restaurant Ototo, says that many sake-makers are now \"\"explicitly\"\" mentioning wine in their English language literature. \"\"And they are suggesting that consumers enjoy sake from stemware [wine glasses] rather than worrying about procuring more traditional vessels like ochoko and guinomi [sake cups],\"\" she says.\r\n\r\nMs Kaplan adds that some sake producers talk about pairing sake with non-Japanese foods. \"\"As an example, we sell a sake called \'Cowboy\' that is only sold on the export maker, and was developed by the brewery specifically to demonstrate to Americans that sake can pair with steak or beef.\r\n\r\n\"\"We also serve sake with oysters at the restaurant, which are loved around the world. It\'s also a great pairing with pizza - sake shares high levels of the amino acid called glutamate with tomatoes and Parmesan cheese, making it a natural fit.\"\"\r\n\"\r\n', 'images\\article_11.webp', '2023-03-01', '10:47:00', 1002),

These gases warm the atmosphere, contributing to global warming and climate change.\r\n\r\nDemand for flights is expected to increase, and governments and the aviation industry are experimenting with ways to reduce the climate impacts of traditional kerosene fuel.\r\n\r\nThe authors of the Royal Society report looked at four options for greener fuels to replace the 12.3m tonnes of jet fuel used annually in the UK.\r\n\r\nIt concluded that none could replace fossil jet fuel in the short term.\r\n\r\nSome airlines now use very small amounts of biofuel, largely made from crops. London Heathrow is the largest global user of biofuels but it accounts for just 0.5% of the airport\'s fuel.\r\n\r\nTo produce enough to supply the UK aviation industry would require half of Britain\'s farming land, putting pressure on food supplies, the Royal Society says.\r\n\r\nAnother option is fuel made from hydrogen produced with green electricity.

It\'s all about \"expressing yourself\", the designer tells Ellie Violet Bramley.\r\n', '\"Even if you have never watched Sex and the City, you probably still know that Carrie Bradshaw once wore a tutu. The look symbolised the TV show. But it could have been very different. The series writer and producer Darren Star didn\'t \"\"get it\"\", says the show\'s costume designer Patricia Field in her new book. \"\"Who\'s going to understand this girl, in New York, in a tutu?\"\" He wanted to put her in a powder blue frock for the opening credits instead. \r\n\r\nIt sums up the way many people feel about costumes created by Field, who has been responsible not only for the wardrobe of Sex and the City but also those of Ugly Betty, The Devil Wears Prada and Emily in Paris. The apparent randomness of the now-82-year-old New Yorker\'s ensembles, as well as their rollercoaster extremes, provoke a range of reactions in audience – delight, bafflement and even anger.\r\n\r\nThe outfits worn by Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City were iconic – or perplexing, depending on your point of view (Credit: Alamy)\r\nThe outfits worn by Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City were iconic – or perplexing, depending on your point of view (Credit: Alamy)\r\n\r\nField herself has an idea why her costumes get some people so hot under the collar. \"\"Maybe they don\'t have air conditioning!\"\" she jokingly tells BBC Culture. \"\"Don\'t take yourself so seriously. Enjoy yourself! Enjoy life! Try a little originality!\"\"\r\n\r\nWhat is it about Field\'s costumes that makes them so divisive? The half-Armenian, half-Greek, US-born fashion renegade has always been about individuality not trends, a mixing of styles and a bending of rules. Although now she is known as the woman who dressed Carrie Bradshaw, she was a stalwart of the New York underground scene. She ran shops frequented by Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring, Patti Smith and Debbie Harry, and was a fixture on the ballroom scene, as well as an incubator for young, diverse design talent. Her store, she writes in a new memoir, became a \"\"global destination for freaky fashion. People came from all over the country and abroad to see what tricks we had up our neoprene sleeves\"\". \r\n\r\nSATC was the first time that kind of high-fashion was shown on TV characters without it being purely for comedy – as it had been on British series Absolutely Fabulous. It is one thing knowing that designer fashion happens, on catwalks and the rarefied pages of Vogue, but another seeing it on terrestrial TV, especially drama; these are characters that on some level, however aspirational or escapist the show, we are meant to relate to. But they collect their dry-cleaning wearing Manolo Blahniks. \r\n\r\nThe clothes, like an extra layer of characterisation, will annoy in the same way that Carrie annoys even, at times, her best friends\r\nUp until Sex and the City came on TV, \"\"costume was very much in the background,\"\" says Kevin Freeman, a professor of costume design at Wimbledon College of Arts. \"\"When I was training, the teaching was that if it\'s a good design, you tend not to notice it.\"\" SATC placed the clothes centre stage, \"\"which is what Field tends to do whenever she does film or TV work, the clothes have their own role within the piece. You either embrace that and run with it or you don\'t.\"\" \r\n\r\nA stalwart of the New York underground scene in the 1970s and 80s, Patricia Field went on to dress  stars of TV and film (Credit: Getty Images)\r\nA stalwart of the New York underground scene in the 1970s and 80s, Patricia Field went on to dress stars of TV and film (Credit: Getty Images)\r\n\r\nField does nothing to tame fashion\'s more extreme edges: \"\"Carrie wearing a bird on her head or going down the street in a ballgown, that way of playing with high fashion simply hadn\'t been used before,\"\" says Pamela Church Gibson, reader in cultural and historical studies at the London College of Fashion. This is what many viewers love and find joyful and empowering about Field\'s work, and the characters that wear it – the unapologetic way they get dressed according to mood and not convention. But it galls others.\r\n\r\nThe somewhat ironic thing is that Field\'s work is anti-trend. Take Bradshaw\'s tutu. It made such a lasting impression precisely because it wasn\'t on-trend. As Field writes, \"\"I knew anything less would be dated by next season. People want to see what they haven\'t seen before – not some trendy shift dress from fall 19-90-whatever.\"\" Yet people view SATC\'s looks as emblematic of high-fashion\'s most outrageous tendencies.\r\n\r\nField\'s costumes get some people angry in the same way that fashion in general gets some people angry, both for good reasons and bad. On the one hand there is the materialism and consumerism of it all – the rate of costume changes and extravagance of wearing couture to lunch don\'t sit well on a burning planet. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is the fact that fashion in general is often viewed as superficial and frivolous in ways other art forms usually swerve. The fact that it is traditionally associated with women is no coincidence. \"\"There were a lot of criticisms that because these women take so much pleasure in clothes that it was simple-minded,\"\" says Deborah Jermyn, a reader in film and television at Roehampton University and author of a 2009 book about SATC – \"\"that you can\'t be saying something critical and socially interesting if you are also interested in fashion.\"\"\r\n\r\nCertain items came in for specific criticism. Take the nameplate necklace now so synonymous with Bradshaw that to many it is known simply as the \"\"Carrie necklace\"\". It was something, Field says in her book, that she spotted on the young Hispanic and African-American customers who came to her shop. When asked, she is straightforward in her take: \"\"Yes, I appropriated the name necklace from the multitude of young, gorgeous girls who were my customers in my shop,\"\" she tells BBC Culture. \"\"The name necklace always caught my eye, but I have always given the credit to them. At the time, I thought \'Let me show this to Sarah Jessica!\' Happily she liked it.\"\"\r\n\r\nBut, says Jermyn, \"\"the series itself is consumed in a way [in which] that gets lost, and clearly that\'s really problematic\"\". The show was criticised for its whiteness, its characters criticised for their racist behaviour, and the costumes cannot be untangled from that.\r\n\r\nThere are privileges inherent in these outfits. \"\"I think it\'s important to think about class and \'appropriate bodies\' as well as whiteness,\"\" says Jermyn. \"\"If a working-class woman or woman of colour or a large-bodied woman dresses in a comparable way that is perceived to be \'loud\' or \'over-accessorised\', that would be received very differently from the kind of pushback that somebody like Lily Collins or Sarah Jessica Parker gets.\"\" She continues: \"\"You can think about the kind of things to celebrate around refusing to fit in a box but you still have to ask the question who gets to be able to make that refusal.\"\"\r\n\r\nIf the clothes are inextricable from the characters, then so is the anger they elicit. From Carrie to Lily Collins\'s Emily, the characters that Field dresses aren\'t always the most popular. Emily is a peppy young American in Paris, a 20-something marketing executive who eats, sleeps and breathes social media. Her clothes speak to that. Take the day she showed up to her new job in France, without speaking a word of French but wearing a tourist-chic blouse with a picture of the Eiffel Tower on it. Field, who co-designed season one with French colleague Marylin Fitoussi, and stayed on as costume consultant for season two, paired it with Christian Louboutin boots with \"\"Paris\"\" emblazoned across them and a satchel handbag that, Field writes, is \"\"often associated with French women\"\".\r\n\r\n\"\"The ensemble,\"\" she continues, \"\"was consciously trying too hard, just like Emily. Her outfit for her first day of work was an unequivocal, if not slightly misguided, love letter to France\'s capital.\"\" Her penchant for literal dressing, from the berets to the Mona Lisa tote, fits perfectly with her pep.\r\n\r\nFor the finale of season two, Emily attends a fashion show in Versailles\' hall of mirrors in a voluminous, frothy tulle gown from the 2019 Giambattista Valli x H&M collaboration; the perfect metaphor for Field\'s love of high/low fashion. The dress takes up a lot of literal and metaphorical space, adding fuel to the fire of the sartorial culture war that rages throughout the series. It is, says Jermyn, about \"\"cultural hierarchies, these notions of Euro-chic versus the idea of Americans as brash. It is about dominating – her clothes take over when she enters a space.\"\"\r\n\r\nBreaking the rules\r\n\r\nThe clothes feed into that sense that these aren\'t characters the audience is necessarily meant to like, at least not 100% of the time. Going back to the tutu, Field knew what she was doing: \"\"It\'s the princess syndrome,\"\" she told Darren Star. The clothes, like an extra layer of characterisation, will annoy in the same way that Carrie annoys even, at times, her best friends. \r\n\r\nIn terms of not being understood – or outright disliked – Field\'s costumes also often subvert ideas of how women have traditionally been expected to present themselves. When fashion blogger Leandra Medine Cohen started her Man Repeller fashion blog in 2010, it seemed to offer a label for the kind of dressing that had been Carrie\'s bread and butter. Carrie will wear a baker boy hat and a poncho, and silhouettes that swamp her slender frame, as well as corsages bigger than the strappy tops they are pinned to. On a day at the beach in the Hamptons she wears tropical-print board shorts, a clashing bikini top and pink-tinted sunglasses. Out shopping she will wear an 80s bubblegum-pink prom frock. In one infamous look she wears a lime-green skirt with pink crop top and a belt around her bare waist, decoration without even a hint of functionality.\r\n\r\nLook to Emily and with outfits such as her season two ensemble of a pink fur-trimmed cardigan teamed with multi-coloured parachute trousers, fingerless white gloves and a plaid newsboy cap, there is a clear throughline. \r\n\r\nThese ensembles seem to be saying \'look at me\', but they\'re not saying \'I want to attract admirers or attention that is sexualised\' – Deborah Jermyn\r\nThis so-called \"\"man repeller\"\" aspect is very \"\"telling about some of the things that are at stake in all this,\"\" says Jermyn. \"\"These ensembles seem to be saying \'look at me\', they welcome a gaze –  these are clothes that say \'I\'m aware that this is going to attract attention\' – but they\'re not saying I want to attract admirers or attention that is sexualised. They\'re not about saying I\'m dressing to appreciate my sexiness.\"\" There is, she says, \"\"something that people really feel confused and angered by in that.\"\"\r\n\r\nField dresses women who feel emboldened to dress for themselves. Certainly they sometimes dress in a \"\"sexy\"\" way, but they do so out of choice. It speaks volumes that what Field describes in her book as the \"\"straight types from HBO\"\" thought \"\"the only way to read sexy on screen was by trotting out the old stereotype of big boobs, miniskirts and high heels\"\". Whereas Field interpreted it by putting a \"\"powerful, libidinous woman like Samantha\"\" in designer bodysuits by Giorgio di Sant\' Angelo. Does Field think there is anything in the fact that (heterosexual) men often don\'t seem to \"\"get\"\" her work, at least at first? \"\"I feel sorry for them,\"\" she says, \"\"because they are locked into the same conservative wardrobe over and over. In general, men do not have the opportunity to be creative and expressive about how they present themselves. They solve that problem by wearing T-shirts and polo shirts.\"\"\r\n\r\nField\'s school of dressing ignores pre-set rules. \"\"Partly it\'s to do with blurring what\'s daywear, what\'s nightwear, those sorts of surprises about what they wear to what spaces,\"\" says Jermyn. For Emily, she writes, she took elegant high-end pieces by Greek designer Vassilis Zoulias \"\"on a plunging rollercoaster ride, by pairing one with the lowest of the low\"\" a bucket hat by an ultra-fast fashion label. For those hung up on the rules of good taste, or the idea of appropriateness, this can feel unnerving. \r\n\r\nFor Field, the fact that Meryl Streep\'s ruthless fashion editor character, Miranda Priestley, in 2006 film The Devil Wears Prada, would have \"\"white, high-style and shocking\"\" hair made perfect sense, Field writes in her book. But the producers didn\'t agree, she writes. \"\"To them, white equalled old lady.\"\" As Jermyn puts it: \"\"It\'s still taken as something unexpected. It is risky because it foregrounds questions of age when women are constantly being told to hide and erase the signs of aging.\"\" But in the figure of Priestly you have an older woman trying to bust out of archaic, gendered stereotypes of how she \"\"should\"\" age. \r\n\r\nField breaks and rebuilds constructs at will, pairs high and low, luxury and fast fashion with abandon, clashing prints and styles. But it runs deeper, says Jermyn, to pushing boundaries in \"\"much bigger senses\"\" exploding \"\"our expectations of how women should conform through clothes\"\". Through her work, she has offered a blueprint for sartorial self-expression. \r\n\r\nSo does the woman who showed such fearlessness in dressing some of the most famous fictional characters in recent history understand why some people might feel afraid to wear what they want? \"\"I have no idea,\"\" Field tells BBC Culture, \"\"you\'d have to ask them\"\". But for her personally, \"\"I have no fear in both fashion and in general. The main idea is to express yourself in an educated and interesting way.\"\"\r\n\"\r\n', 'images\\article_15.webp', '2023-02-18', '13:32:00', 1004),
(16, 'David Silverberg\r\n', 'Lasers, drones and AI: The future of weeding\r\n', '\"No-one likes weeding, but new technology is helping farmers around the world tackle weeds in a more efficient and environmentally friendly way.\r\n\"\r\n', '\"Deanna Kovar from US farming equipment giant John Deere says that the company\'s new tractor-pulled weed sprayer can reduce herbicide use by two thirds.\r\n\r\nThe system, called See & Spray Ultimate, looks like a typical field sprayer, in that two long arms or \"\"booms\"\" stick out either side of the tractor, with spraying nozzles dotted along the underside of each.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this sprayer far more high-tech, is that it is fitted with 36 cameras. These constantly scan the plants in front of them, instantly identifying what is a crop and what is a weed.\r\n\r\nControlled by an artificial intelligence (AI) software system, the connected sprinklers then only spray herbicide onto the individual weeds rather than drenching the entire field.\r\n\r\n\"\"Our system is capturing two million pixels per second, so it is seeing and processing a lot,\"\" says Ms Kovar, who is vice president of Production and Precision Agriculture Production Systems at John Deere.\r\n\r\nTo help the software identify the weeds, there are more than 300,000 images on a John Deere database.\r\n\r\nThe system currently works with three crops - corn, soybean and cotton - and is so far only available in the US.\r\n\r\nFor farmers elsewhere in the world, a number of rival firms, both large and small, have developed similar smart-weeding technologies. These include German company Bosch BASF Smart Farming, whose camera-scanning weeder is called Smart Spraying Solution.\r\n\r\nA number of farm weeding machines use cameras and software systems to target individual weeds\r\n\"\"The biggest challenge in farming is how weeds compete with crops for space, nutrients and water,\"\" says Nadav Bocher, chief executive and co-founder of Israeli firm Greeneye Technology, another manufacturer of AI-powered precision weeding systems.\r\n\r\nHis comments echo a 2021 study which said that the annual financial impact of weeds on just one specific crop - winter wheat in the US and Canada - could total $2.2bn (£1.8bn).\r\n\r\n\"\"It\'s hard to imagine what kind of catastrophic damage farming has done in the past decades [due to excessive use of herbicide],\"\" says Mr Bocher, who claims that Greeneye\'s system can reduce usage levels by 80%.\r\n\r\n\"\"With such a high level of soil pollution created for no reason, that goes back to us as consumers, and hurts the entire ecosystem.\"\"\r\n\r\nMr Bocher adds that while high-tech weeding systems are expensive, Greeneye\'s can pay for itself in less than two seasons, due to reduced herbicide costs and higher crop yields.\r\n\r\n\"\"AI is such a steep change in farming\'s evolution, it\'s like moving from ox to tractor,\"\" says Daniel McCann, who leads a company that is also infusing AI tech into a spraying solution for farmers. But with a twist in this case - his company, Precision AI, uses drones to fly over fields in the US Midwest to target weeds.\r\n\r\nBased in Regina, Saskatchewan in Canada, Precision AI fed their database with more than two million images. Mr McCann says this huge number was necessary because \"\"the same crop can look very different if it was planted in, say, sandier soil compared to soil that gets lots of rain and sun\"\".\r\n\r\nBosch BASF Smart Farming\'s technology works in a similar way to John Deere\'s\r\nFlying around 10ft (3m) above the ground, the precision spraying drones can bring peace of mind, says Mr McCann. \"\"We now live in a world where the market is increasingly more aware of what\'s in their food, and demanding less chemicals on their fruits and veggies and everything else.\"\"\r\n\r\nBut whatever the advanced spraying method may look like, farmers still face an uphill battle against weeds. \"\"Some weeds evolve to look more like the crop and they can be harder to find,\"\" says Michael Gore, a professor at the SIPS Plant Breeding and Genetics Section at Cornell University.\r\n\r\n\"\"Biology often wins in the end, but I like how companies are coming out with these tools that are constantly evolving.\"\"\r\n\r\nGiven the high cost of these new weeding technologies, some experts would like to see farmers given financial help from their governments, so that they can afford to buy them.\r\n\r\n\"\"There is a need for substantive financial subsidies that could help farmers overcome the initial lack of cost-effectiveness of digital technologies,\"\" says Prof Mihalis Kritikos, policy analyst at the European Parliament, and an expert on the legal and ethical aspects of new and emerging technologies.\r\n\r\nOne weeding innovation that moves away from spraying herbicides altogether instead uses high-powered thermal lasers that zap weeds once they have been identified by AI-enabled cameras.\r\n\r\nCalled the LaserWeeder, it has been developed by Seattle-based Carbon Robotics, which claims that it can eliminate up to 100,000 weeds per hour when pulled along by a tractor.\r\n\r\nThe LaserWeeder does as its name suggests - it burns weeds away using a laser\r\nThe lasers destroy weeds instantly, and the burnt remains are composted back into the soil, explains Paul Mikesell, Carbon Robotics\' chief executive.\r\n\r\nSo far the system has been used on fields of potatoes, onions and garlic in US states such as California, Washington and Idaho.\r\n\r\nMr Mikesell adds that the first units sold out when released last year, and it is now manufacturing more for the US and Canadian markets. Expansion into Europe is said to be further down the road.\r\n\r\nKilling weeds with lasers allows farmer to avoid the dreaded \"\"spray drift\"\" that can happen with herbicide spraying, even if the targeting is as exact as possible. \"\"If you spray anything outside, it will always drift in some way,\"\" Mr Mikesell says.\"\r\n', 'images\\article_16.webp', '2023-02-27', '10:11:00', 1002),
